**What PySimlink is not:**

* A replacement to the `Simulink Coder <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html>`_.

   * This does not generate code for a Simulink model. You still need the Simulink Coder.

* A replacement for the `MATLAB Engine For Python <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html>`_

   * This does not interact with MATLAB in any way. It only interacts with your generated model.

* A repository containing **any** Mathworks library header files.

   * Distributing library header files from any Mathworks program or its content is a violation
     of the MathWorks license agreement, with the exception of code generated by the Simulink Coder.
